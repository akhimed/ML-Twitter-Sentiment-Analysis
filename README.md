# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This code performs sentiment analysis on a given tweet using the Twitter-RoBERTa model trained on ~58M tweets and finetuned for sentiment analysis with the TweetEval benchmark. This code replaces user mentions with '@user' and removing URLs, and then predicting the sentiment (negative, neutral, or positive) with associated confidence scores.
